title: The Best Blogs and Newsletters in Data Science
---

This is one of things that I struggled for a long time, I used to subscribe every data science newsletters I came across. But over the period of time, I have found which blogs and newsletters are worth following and reading. Below are the newsletters that I never miss

1. Oreilly Data Nesletter: *This is directly coming from the house of oreilly.Read it first and then decide.*
2. Data Elixir: *This newsletter has come a long way. I suggested some changes last year and they got implemented. Its beautifully structered now. It has tutorials and top articles sections*
3. Data Science Roundup: *One thing I liked about this newsletter is author provides her/his personal comments about why he/she liked it*



A few blogs which I regularly check out and highly informative.

1. [locallyoptimistic](https://locallyoptimistic.com/)
2. [Frank Harrell's Blog](https://www.fharrell.com/)
3. [Sean Taylor's Blog](https://seanjtaylor.com/)
4. [Roger Peng's Blog](https://simplystatistics.org/)



Personaly I didnot find higher ratio of good articles in towardsdatascience medium blog. Those half-baked blog posts can cost you a job.   

*Disclaimer: This is not a sponsored article.Its my personal preference*
