This is one of things that I struggled for a long time, I used to subscribe every data science newsletters I came across. But over the period of time, I have which blogs and newsletters are worth following and reading. Below are the newsletters that I never miss

2. Data Elixir: *This newsletter has come a long way. I suggested some changes last year and they got implemented. Its beautifully structered now. It has tutorials and top articles sections*
3. Data Science Roundup: *One thing I liked about this newsletter is author provides his personal comments about why he liked it*
