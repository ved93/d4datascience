title: What is law of large numbers?
---


In the last blog post, we discussed about law of large numbers. It tells us that if you repeat an experiment independently a large number of times and average the result, then this sample mean will converge to true expected value. But it does not tell us much about the details of the distribution of sample mean. The CLT provides us exactly with this kind of details. It tells us that the sum of many independent identically distributed random variables has approximately a normal distribution. 



Let X1,X2,...,Xn be i.i.d. random variables with expected value EXi=μ<∞ and variance 0<Var(Xi)=σ2<∞. Then, the random variable
Zn=(X¯−μ)/(σ/√n)=(X1+X2+...+Xn−nμ)/σ√n
converges in distribution to the standard normal random variable as n goes to infinity, that is
limn→∞P(Zn≤x)=Φ(x), for all x∈R,
where Φ(x) is the standard normal CDF.
