title: How to do better code-reviews!
---

Most data scientists work in and out with jupyter notebooks. I am not touching on why notebooks as it has extreme opinions on both sides. Engineering-centric folks prefer production code to be in scripts while data science-centric folks love their notebooks. Irrespective of contrasting opinions all agree that our code should be clean and readable. 
A practice like code reviews serves a great purpose in achieving that. It might be daunting for someone to have their first code review and think that people are picking mistakes in their code. If you approach this way it will hamper your learning. Honestly, this is the same way when I had my first code review a few years back and felt angry for multiple revisions in the code. I was not told the importance of code review and why its important. Then I came across a tweet thread about code review and its importance. After that I used to be excited for code reviews. 
The goal of code reviews is not only improve the code but also to share knowledge and improve the skills of everyone in the team. If you happen to be the first code reviewer of someone, do talk about why we are doing code reviews. Then people will feel excited about the code reviews and learn from it.
Now lets talk about how to do better code reviews!
- **Understand the change**: Whenever you are reviewing the code, first understand the change. If you are not able to understand the change, ask the author to explain the change. IMHO, you should not do code review if you dont want to understand the change.
- **Check for best practices**: There are some best practices which are followed in the codebase. Check if the author has followed them. If not, ask them to follow it. 
- **Look for simplicity**: The change should be simple and easy to understand. If you find it complex, ask the author to simplify it.
- **Higher level focus**: Dont focus too much on variable names but focus on how it's connected with the convention of the codebase. 
- **Approach from design perspective** Take a step back and think if it makes sense from design perspective or not.

I presented the broad guidelines for code reviews. If you have any more suggestions or feedback, please let me know. I would love to hear from you.
