title: what is Agile data science?
---

You must be wondering what is agile data science. People working in engineering have known this 'agile' term from a long time. People have figured out agile methodology is best way to get something done in engineering.
What is Agile methodology?
AGILE methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project. In the Agile model, both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the Waterfall model.

Agile methodology can't be fully implemented in data science. There are some stark differences between software development and data science.  
1. In Software development, problems are mostly deterministic and you know requirements upfront.   
In Data Science, mostly problems are exploratory and highly creative in nature. You dont whether you could solve the problem or not.
2. In Software development, there is always a tangible output. While, in Data Science, if your model didnot work then there is no tangible output other than an insight. 
   
After facing series of failed projects, it forced me to come up with something to reduce failure rate and it was inspired by agile software development. 
As andrew Ng also talks about you should release your first MVP fast. It should be time bound. Usually any POC on data science projects takes around 4-6 weeks. It helps us to decide whether we are working in right direction or not. 
This agile data science helped to quickly finish multiple projects. After first MVP, frame your solutioning in iterations just like agile software development. 

Advantages: 
1. Helps you quickly identify failures in projects
2. You dont explore unpromising directions.
   
Framing your data science projects into meaningful iterations is a difficult task and thats a story for next blog.
