title: What is law of large numbers?
---


The law of large numbers has a central role in probability and statistics. It states that if you repeat an experiment independently a large number of times and average the result, what you obtain should be close to the expected value. There are two main versions of the law of large numbers. They are called the weak and strong laws of the large numbers. The difference between them is mostly theoretical. Here, we will discuss weak law of large numbers.

For i.i.d. random variables X1,X2,...,Xn with finite mean mu and variance sigma square, the sample mean, denoted by Mn, is defined as
=(X1+X2+...+Xn)/n

The sample mean is the simplest and most natural way for trying to estimate the true mean of the population and the weak law of large numbers will provide some support to this notion.

Lets look at some properties of sample mean below

The last equation is application of The chebyshev inequality. 
So the probability of falling far from the mean diminishes to zero as we draw more and more samples. Thats exactly what the weak law of large numbers tells us.  
If we fix any particular positive epsilon constant, the probability that the sample mean falls away from the true mean by more than epsilon, that probability becomes smaller and smaller and converges to 0 as n goes to inifinity.
