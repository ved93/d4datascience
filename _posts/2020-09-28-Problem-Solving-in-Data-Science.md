title: Problem-Solving in Data Science
---


Few years back, when I started my journey in data-science, I was fascinated by Kaggle. I used to devote my time there. I was overwhelmed by the knowledge and problems. I wanted to be competitive and then kaggle shows their leaderboard and prize. You win and make a name. 
I usually had lunch and casual discussion with my manager. We used to discuss about what kind of things should be taught in school and how should they be taught. One day I asked my manager which things are most important in data science and what's his opinion about Kaggle.
He said **Problem Solving** is one of the most important skill in data scientist. As far as kaggle is concerned I dont think Kaggle helps you to become a good problem solver.
